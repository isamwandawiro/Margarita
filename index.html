    🍸 Margarita
   </h1>
   <p>
    A margarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice. 
    Some margarita recipes include simple syrup as well and are often served with salt on the rim of the glass. Margaritas can be served either shaken with ice (on the rocks), 
    without ice (straight up), or blended with ice (frozen margarita)
